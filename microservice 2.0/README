                                              WELCOME TO LINE EDITOR
Please read below for more information about how to request and receive data with this microservice


1. REQUEST
    Once the application is started, the user requests data by following a command line interface that will ask the user
    a series of questions. This involves asking the user which manuscript they would like to access (which is currently
    saved in local text files) and then asks the user whether they would like to add, remove, replace, or add a note to
    a line.

2. RECEIVE
    Once the user goes through and requests the data, the system will print out the manuscript in it's entirety to make
    sure the editing portion is done correctly.
